Understanding Population Decline Trajectories in Spain using Sequence Analysis

This repository includes data and code to replicate the paper:

Gonz√°lez-Leonardo, M., Newsham, N., & Rowe, F. (2023). Understanding Population Decline Trajectories in Spain using Sequence Analysis. Geographical Analysis. https://doi.org/10.1111/gean.12357.

There are 5 folders in the repository:

1.Sequence analysis: to replicate stage 2 of the study (see data and methods section in the  paper for more details).

2.Maps: to replicate the maps of stage 1 (population growth) and stage 3 (geographical distribution of depopulation trajectories).

3.Correlation: to repclicate the correlation analysis of stage 3.

4.Contribution: to replicate stage 4 (contribution of natural change, net internal migration and net international migration).

5.Multinomial_model: to replicate stage 5 (multinomial model to explore contextual factors). There is not dataset for this stage, since some data we used were not open access (see data and methods section in the paper to check where the data should be requested from).
